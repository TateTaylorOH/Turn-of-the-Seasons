﻿Turn of the Seasons is a mod that hopes to utilize the new [Seasons of Skyrim SKSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62861) framework to implement a full set of visually distinct seasons to the game while staying true to Skyrim's aesthetics.

The changes have been made to feel natural and not to overdo the seasonal variations. It still feels like Skyrim, but now you get to experience it's beautiful environment as it transforms around you while playing!

**Midyear | Sun's Height | Last Seed**

Skyrim begins in the very last days of Summer, for the first 15 days of your playthrough you will be able to experience the season. Great care was put into this season as it will be the first one the Player will see. It is distinctly warmer and more vibrant than Skyrim's classic Autumn setting.

-   Trees and other foliage in the Rift is a mix of green and yellow.
-   The grass in the Rift is a vibrant green.
-   Trees in the Reach are covered in deep green leaves.
-   More grass can be found growing in the Northern Holds than usual.
-   The Whiterun tundra is completely void of snow (same as Vanilla).

**Hearthfire | Frostfall | Sun's Dusk**

The majority of the game is set in the Autumn months, so much of Skyrim is already suited for this season. However, a few changes to make the season feel more present across the province.

-   Dustings of snow can be seen across the Whiterun tundra.
-   The trees in the Reach now sport brown Autumn leaves.
-   Trees in the Rift adopt their iconic orange coloring (same as Vanilla).

[Seasons of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62861) already includes a robust Winter season; pair it with ws's [Shrubs of Snow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63463) and it looks truly breathtaking. Regardless, a few changes have been made to the season for some added flair.

-   The Whiterun tundra is now completely covered by a thick layer of snow.
-   Lakes and rivers across Skyrim can be found frozen over in certain places (Optional).
-   Trees in the Rift are dead and leafless.
-   Trees in the Reach are dead and leafless (same as Vanilla).

**First Seed | Rain's Hand | Second Seed**

After Skyrim's harsh winter comes a welcome Spring that is full of life. The province is much greener than normal as plants begin to bloom. While being similar to Summer the Spring season still has a unique identity.

-   Trees and other foliage in the Rift are all a solid green.
-   The grass in the Rift is a vibrant green.
-   Trees in the Reach are covered in deep green leaves.
-   More grass can be found growing in the Northern Holds than usual.

**Winter Fixes**

Turn of the Seasons also includes several mesh fixes for the base Winter season from [Seasons of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62861). Hopefully the presence of hard seams between textures should be mitigated.

Seams begone!

**Wyrmstooth Integration**

Additionally, this mod has built-in support for Wyrmstooth, ensuring that you can experience all of Skyrim's seasons on everyone's favorite island to the north!

**Recommended Mods**

Base [Seasons of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62861) didn't create winter variants for a lot of assets, so when winter hits much of the foliage is still bright vibrant colors. [Shrubs of Snow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63463) addresses this by creating Winter variants for all of these missed plants; it is basically essential in order to experience the Winter season as intended.

Turn of the Seasons only effects how the world looks around you, it does not edit weather in any way. It is recommended you pair this mod with a seasonal weather mod such as [Obsidian Weathers and Seasons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12125). The seasonal weather should begin and end in the proper months,

If you are a fan of survival experiences then consider [Survival Mode Improved](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56374) or [SunHelm Survival and Needs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414). Both of these mods offer rich survival gameplay with seasonal mechanics. As the seasons change around you the temperature should change along with it.
