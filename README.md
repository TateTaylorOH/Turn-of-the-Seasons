﻿Turn of the Seasons is a mod that hopes to utilize the new Seasons of Skyrim SKSE framework to implement a full set of visually distinct seasons to the game while staying true to Skyrim's aesthetics.

Great care has been taken in making sure the changes feel natural and don't overdo the seasonal variations. It still feels like Skyrim, but now you get to experience it's beautiful environment as it transforms around you while playing!

Skyrim begins in the very last days of Summer, for the first 15 days of your playthrough you will be able to experience the season. We made sure to put great care into this season as it will be the first one the Player will see. It is distinctly warmer and more vibrant than Skyrim's classic Autumn setting.

-   Trees and other foliage in the Rift is a mix of green and yellow.
-   The grass in the Rift is a vibrant green.
-   Trees in the Reach are covered in deep green leaves.
-   More grass can be found growing in the Northern Holds than usual.
-   The Whiterun tundra is completely void of snow (same as Vanilla).

**Hearthfire | Frostfall | Sun's Dusk**

The majority of Skyrim is set in the Autumn months so much of Skyrim is already suited for this season. However we have made a few changes to make the season feel more present across the province.

-   Dustings of snow can be seen across the Whiterun tundra.
-   The trees in the Reach now sport brown Autumn leaves.
-   Trees in the Rift adopt their iconic orange coloring (same as Vanilla).

The base Seasons of Skyrim already includes a robust Winter season. Pair it with ws's [Shrubs of Snow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63463) and it looks truly breathtaking. Regardless, we have made a few changes to the season for some added flair.

-   The Whiterun tundra is now completely covered by a thick layer of snow.
-   Lakes and rivers across Skyrim can be found frozen over in certain places.
-   Trees in the Reach are dead and leafless (same as Vanilla).

**First Seed | Rain's Hand | Second Seed**

After Skyrim's harsh winter comes a welcome Spring that is full of life. The province is much greener than normal as plants begin to bloom. While being similar to Summer the Spring season still has its a unique identity.

-   Trees and other foliage in the Rift are all a solid green.
-   The grass in the Rift is a vibrant green.
-   Trees in the Reach are covered in deep green leaves.
-   More grass can be found growing in the Northern Holds than usual.

## Winter Fixes

Turn of the Seasons also includes several mesh fixes for the base Winter season from Seasons of Skyrim. Hopefully the presence of hard seams between textures should be mitigated.

Seams begone!

## Wyrmstooth Integration

Additionally, this mod has built-in support for Wyrmstooth, ensuring that you can experience all of Skyrim's seasons in everyone's favorite island to the north!
